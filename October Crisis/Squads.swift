This class is used to do squad based management such as creating a squad or modifing it.

Each squads() instance is a different squad containing 6 characters.
Each squad has to be created with a name and I should give it an ID number
for easy referal. 

In game we should create an empty squad initially. When we press 'create new squad' we should get a
window to force a player to put in a squad name, then click accept. At the accept, an ID is given to
the squad. The squad is then placed in an array in the game world that contains all the squads.


When the game loads, I need
